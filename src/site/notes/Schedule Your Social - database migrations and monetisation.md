I've tried several ways to monetise Schedule Your Social without success.

Initially I tried adding a Buy Me A Coffee button. Several people clicked on it over the years but no-one ever donated.

Then I tried an Amazon associates ad for Liquid Death. Again, a very small percentage of the hundreds of unique visitors clicked it but never purchased (actually I think I earned $2 in the Canada account but I didn't bother cashing it out).

Now I've learned that the database service I use, FaunaDB, will be [ceasing operations on May 30th](https://fauna.com/blog/the-future-of-fauna) of this year (2025). It will probably take me about two days to migrate the codebase to another service and I'm unsure about investing that much time at the moment as I have a full-time job and two young children.

So I've decided to use this as an opportunity to really test if users find it valuable or not by adding a banner soliciting donations to keep the site running.

I think I've made this pretty slick as it includes a donate button which opens the Buy Me A Coffee widget in-app.

I've also created a page that explains the situation more.

I'm looking for about $200 to feel its worth the time investment but am setting my expectations that in all likelihood no-one will donate and this will most likely be the end of Schedule Your Social!

I'm sad because I've put a lot of time into this and I've become fond and rather proud of it. However I only have limited time to work on hobby projects and need to focus on others which I'm equally passionate about and can be better monetised.
