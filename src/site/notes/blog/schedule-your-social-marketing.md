Schedule Your Social is a little scheduling app I made that I've been trying to figure out the marketing for. I'd really like to achieve a growth engine for organic traffic that just sticks to the basics and doesn't rely on gimmicks or underhand / spammy methods.

My current idea is to target the keywords "host a board game night" following the formula laid out in [[seo\|seo]].
