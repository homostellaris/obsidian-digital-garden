I'm trying to get organic traffic to my web app [Schedule Your Social ](https://scheduleyour.social) so I read a bit about SEO and used ChatGPT to write a blog post I thought would resonate with my target audience ðŸ˜…

This didn't work, as in I didn't get one single page visit. I later read that the blog posts actually have to be good to get any traction which was fair enough. So this time I wrote a whole blog post myself about how to organise a D&D session and made sure it checked all the 'SEO boxes'.

To my disappointment this didn't get a single page visit either! I had low expectations but I expected at least one visit in several months. However I can't find my humble blog post *anywhere* on Google search results. I've checked Google Search Console and addressed any issues (there were only a couple of minor ones) but still no luck.

So it's back to the drawing board! The next thing I'm going to investigate is the lack of a sitemap. I thought that traffic would still be crawled without one and it wouldn't make a huge amount of difference but I could be wrong.
