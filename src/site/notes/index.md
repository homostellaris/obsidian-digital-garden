Welcome to the public notes of Daniel Tariq Metcalfe (aka *Homostellaris*).
# What will you find here?
Here you will find anything that I feel may be useful or thought-provoking to others.

Or more likely you will find subjective nonsense designed to satisfy my own self-satisfaction and OCD desire to aimlessly document things I mistakenly believe I have 'figured out'.

Either way, this site may include:
- Ideas
- Guides
- Opinions
- Musings
- Rants
# Who are you?
You can learn more about me on the [[About\|About]] page.
# How did you make this site?
Like anyone else my interests are varied so the topics covered will be broad. As I learn and create I make notes in my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault which are private by default but occasionally I feel like sharing them.

Alongside a day job, parenting, and hobbies I can't justify the time investment to maintain a personal website that will probably never be viewed by anyone but I've found a nice low-maintenance way to scratch that 'writing' and 'sharing' itch using [Flowershow](https://flowershow.app/) which allows me to publish any note I choose straight from my vault.

Thank you to both Obsidian, Flowershow, and all the software they depend upon for making sites like this possible üôè
# Is this a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)?
Kind of, but I don't subscribe to the idea of digital gardens containing everything little thing you think and write in a completely raw form. I like the idea of being 'transparent by default' in other domains but 95% of my notes simply won't deliver value to others and publishing them would only serve to worsen the signal to noise ratio for things that might actually be of interest to others.
