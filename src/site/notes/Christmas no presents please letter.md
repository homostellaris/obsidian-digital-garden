Dear loved ones,

We are lucky to have all the material things we need. The thing we most desire cannot be bought: ***time***. Time to spend with loved ones (that's you); to look after ourselves; to read that book that's been sat on the shelf; or just to sit around appreciating the fact that we're here right now and it *feels good*.

With that in mind we would prefer that you do not spend your time and money purchasing presents for us this Christmas. Right now I imagine terms like "Scrooge", "Grinch", and "miserable nincompoops" are springing to mind but hear us out.

First of all, we cannot decline presents on our children's behalf so they will still be accepting them.

But as adults there are much better things we can spend our precious time on than racking our brains thinking of what to buy each other, stressing ourselves out and running around in a panic, filling our already cluttered homes and bodies with yet more chocolate and socks and alcohol and gift wrap, pointlessly consuming the earth's finite resources, and fuelling society's unhealthy obsession with consumerism. Sometimes you genuinely spot something and think "so-and-so would love that" and sometimes you're right... but if you find something that brilliantly life-changing for someone you should give it to them right away not wait until Christmas! The majority of the time we're just doing what we think is socially required of us and going through the motions which seems a silly way to spend our time when we already feel like we don't see enough of each other as it is.

So our suggestion is that you spend the equivalent time hanging out with us instead! After all, isn't being together what Christmas is *really* all about? The money you save we would prefer you spent on anything you need otherwise we'd really appreciate a donation to our charity of choice: [The Global Health and Development Fund Effective Altruism Fund](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-GB/charities/global-health-and-development-fund?slug=charities&slug=global-health-and-development-fund)

Our belief is that this small adjustment in our traditions will actually bring us closer to the true spirit of Christmas and make it more enjoyable for everyone!

Lots and lots of Christmassy love,
The Metcalfes
