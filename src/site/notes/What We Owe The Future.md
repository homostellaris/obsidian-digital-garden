# Overview
I was already familiar with Longtermism but this book had a huge effect on me. Its very concise and persuasive. It is just fact after fact being shot at you repeatedly to build compelling and often counter-intuitive arguments.

One of many surprise effects of this book was to utterly persuade me of the incredible moral catastrophe that is factory farming and therefore the value of veganism.
# Notes
Future is unknown but we can follow three sensible rules:
- take robustly good actions
- build up options
- learn more

Accelerate adoption of renewables to keep fossil fuels in the ground to be used in case of civilizational collapse.
